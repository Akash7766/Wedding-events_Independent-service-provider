                Authentication verifies who the user is.Authentication works
                through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and
                other information provided or entered by the user.uthentication
                is the first step of a good identity and access management
                process. <br /> <br />
                Authorization determines what resources a user can
                access.Authorization works through settings that are implemented
                and maintained by the organization.Authorization isnâ€™t visible
                to or changeable by the user.
